# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
The most difficult part to tic-tac-toe was creating the make_move function, I did not know how to begin it, which made it difficult. I knew there were 9 possible spots where either player could make a move on the board but I wasn't sure how to structure the function so that it would allow the players make a move on the board. When it was explained in class, it helped me understand how to do it and how I can do other functions similar to this one in the future. 

2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.
I would add a computer player to the game by probably programming it into the program. I could use if else statements to control where the computer player makes a move, the computer would make a move depending on where the player made a move. This would probably need a lot of lines and take time to make. 

3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.
If I were to add a computer player I would get the computer player to play the best move every time by programming the computer player to make certain moves based on what the player did, I could do this by using if else statements on the computer player's moves, this way the computer makes the best possible move it could make so that it is harder for the player to win against it.
